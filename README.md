# Exam-Statistics
Creating a program to compute statistics means that you won't have to whip out your calculator and manually crunch numbers. All you'll have to do is supply a new set of numbers and our program does all of the hard work.  This mini-project will give you some practice with functions, lists, and translating mathematical formulae into programming statements.  In order to use the scores in our program, we'll need them in a container, namely a list.  On the right, you'll see the grades listed (see what I did there). The data is anonymous to protect the privacy of the students.
